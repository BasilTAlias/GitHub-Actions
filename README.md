# üöÄ Host Your Resume on AWS EC2 with CI/CD using GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to set up a simple CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys your resume (or any static web content) to an Amazon EC2 instance every time you push to the `main` branch using **GitHub Actions**.

> ‚úÖ Inspired by the video **"Hosting Your Resume on AWS EC2 with a CI/CD Setup Using GitHub Actions"** from **A Monk in Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è**.  
> I followed the steps from the video, customized it for my environment, and successfully deployed my resume.

## üìå Project Overview

- Automatically deploy static files (like a resume website) to an EC2 instance.
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- Use SSH to securely connect to and update files on the EC2 instance.
- Host the site using Apache on Ubuntu 24.04.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **AWS EC2** (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
- **Apache HTTP Server**
- **GitHub Actions**
- **SSH**
- **HTML/CSS** (for static resume content)

| `EC2_SSH_KEY`     | Your **private SSH key** (`.pem` content) to connect to the EC2 instance |
| `HOST_DNS`        | Public DNS of your EC2 instance (e.g., `ec2-xx-xxx.compute.amazonaws.com`)|
| `USERNAME`        | Username for EC2 (e.g., `ubuntu`)                                         |

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/github-actions-ec2.yml`)

```yaml
name: Push-to-EC2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to EC2 on main branch push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout the files
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy to EC2 Server
        uses: easingthemes/ssh-deploy@main
        env:
          SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          REMOTE_HOST: ${{ secrets.HOST_DNS }}
          REMOTE_USER: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          TARGET: ${{ secrets.TARGET_DIR }}

      - name: Execute remote setup commands
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST_DNS }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            sudo apt update -y
            sudo apt install -y apache2
            sudo systemctl start apache2
            sudo systemctl enable apache2
            cd ${{ secrets.TARGET_DIR }}
            sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
```

## ‚úÖ Steps Followed

1. **Created an EC2 instance** with Ubuntu 24.04 and allowed port 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).
2. **Configured GitHub Secrets** to store SSH key and connection info securely.
3. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow** to automate deployment on every push to `main`.
4. **Tested Deployment** by pushing code and verifying the resume appeared at the EC2 public URL.

---

## üåê Output

Once deployed, your resume is accessible via:

```
http://<your-ec2-public-dns>
```

Example:

```
http://ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```
